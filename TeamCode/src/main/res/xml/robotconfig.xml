    NOTE: The name “Expansion Hub Portal 1” is what the FTC robot controller
    will call this if you scan for it, so leave it set to this value for
    consistency.

    You can retrieve the serial number value of the hub by configuring
    it from the robot controller phone, and taking note of the value
    found there. We always put that serial number (and the port numbers)
    on a label somewhere visible on the hub - to make it straightforward
    to swap in case one becomes damaged.

    If you need to use two REV expansion hubs, you will need to change
    the port number of at least one to something other than the default
    value of ‘2’, see the documentation from FIRST on how to do this at

    https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/skystone/wiki/Using-Two-Expansion-Hubs

    Everywhere that [...] appears, is a value that you must provide:

    * For serial numbers, this must match the value in the physical
    hardware.

    * For a control hub, on the LynxUsbDevice element, the serial number must be
    "(embedded)", the parent module address is as given by the control hub
    itself, but is "2" by default.

    * For port numbers, this must match the actual physical socket
    on the REV hub

    * For names, any value may be used. We always use the same name
    in the XML file, as is used for the variable in Java that refers
    to the physical hardware. We have found that this makes it easier
    to keep things straight.
